# Burp Extension using the Montoya API

This is a starting point to create a Burp Extension with Java and the new Montoya API.
I get autocomplete with this repo and COC of vim and neovim.

## To Create an Extension
- Clone this repo
- Change the `/src/main/java/myextension` and add your source file to it
- Build the project with `gradle build` in the `src/`
- Import the Jar found in the build to Burp
